### Develop a machine learning model that can predict the sale price of houses in Florida using models such as: Random Forest, KNN, and XG Boost

Group Members: Tiffany Chen, Vina Liu, Khoi Thai, Chloe Yin

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop and compare machine learning models that predict the sale price of residential houses in Florida. We implement and evaluate multiple models including: Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and XGBoost using property-level features such as house size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, lot size, and location-based attributes.

This analysis aims to uncover key drivers of housing prices and provide insights that may be useful for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in understanding market behavior and pricing patterns.

### Dataset Overview
This dataset contains detailed information on residential real estate listings across the United States, including property characteristics, pricing, and location data. It is primarily used to analyze housing market trends, price distribution, and regional variations in property features such as lot size, house size, and the number of bedrooms or bathrooms.
