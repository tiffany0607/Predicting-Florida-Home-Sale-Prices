# Predicting-Florida-Home-Sale-Prices
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the sale price of houses in Florida. The model will use property features like house size and number of bedrooms/bathrooms to make predictions. This analysis can help buyers, sellers, and real estate agents better understand price patterns and market behavior.
